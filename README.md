## PHP REST API

Simple lightweight REST API for PHP

The default API root is /1.0 - see config/routes


###Â Environment setup

Assumes that some information is set in environment variables as follows:

    SetEnv APPLICATION_ENV "development"
    SetEnv DATABASE "mydatabase"
    SetEnv DATABASE_USERNAME "mydatabaseuser"
    SetEnv DATABASE_PASSWORD "mydatabasepassword"



### Migrations

In the **development** environment run migrations by going to at https://your-dev-domain.local/migrate

In the **testing** or **production** environments you can only access migrations using the CLI interface as below. Pass the environment as the argument after the controller name.

e.g.

    cd /var/www/my_site_directory/deploy/public
    php index.php migrate testing`


**Important note:** The environment in which the CLI command is being run will need to have the database credentials loaded.

#### Setting environment vars on macOS (temporarily)

If you need to use CLI mode on macOS you can temporarily set environment vars as follows:

    export DATABASE="mydatabase"
    export DATABASE_USERNAME="mydatabaseuser"
    export DATABASE_PASSWORD="mydatabasepassword"

There are many guides for installing them more permanently, such as [this one](https://medium.com/@youngstone89/setting-up-environment-variables-in-mac-os-28e5941c771c)
